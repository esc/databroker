Use this ability only once during each run on this fort.]],
       ruling=[[@ ERRATA  Dr. Dreff should say "Whenever the Runner passes the last piece of ice on this fort or declares a run on it when it has no ice,...." rather than referring to "successful runs."  (Sparky, Netrunner-L, 8/9/96)

@ If the run is being made on a fort other than the one from which cards are to be accessed, Dreff may be used if he is installed in the fort on which the run is being made.  If Dreff were installed in the fort from which cards are to be accessed, he could not be used.  So if you want Dreff to defend you from Shredder Uplink Protocol, you need to install in him in the Archives; Dreff in HQ can't help you against Shredder.  (Sparky, Netrunner-L, 8/9/96)

@ If an effect can remove the ice from play before Dreff trashes the ice (e.g., Marionette), Dreff loses track of the ice and does not trash it.  (Sparky, Netrunner-L, 10/31/96)

@ When Dr. Dreff forces the Runner to encounter ice, that ice is not considered "rezzed" (e.g., the Corp could not gain 3 bits by having Dreff force the Runner to encounter Misleading Access Menus).  (JD Wiker, Netrunner-L, 2/25/97)

@ Ice played via Dr. Dreff is not actually installed anywhere, so there's no such thing as other ice being "outside" it; for instance, if Dreff forces the Runner to encounter a Mastermind, the Mastermind will do zero brain damage and have a strength of zero (unless it is some other ice-strength modifier is in play), regardless of how many layers of ice are installed on this fort. (Tom Wylie via JD Wiker, Netrunner-L, 3/11/96)

@ The Runner never approaches the ice but goes straight to encountering it, so she doesn't have the chance to play abilities before the encounter.  (Official Netrunner Rulings, 4/21/97)

@ If a card refers to the ice "on" the fort, it is referring to ice installed on the fort.  Effects that modify or target ice "on" a fort cannot modify or target ice that Dr. Dreff forces the Runner to encounter. (Skipper Pickle, Netrunner-L, 11/11/97)

@ The Sleepy Ice says '...the cost to rez is reduced by 5..'. Dr Dreff says '...pay half of that card rez cost...'. Since the rez cost is the number shown on top right of a card (as explained on pages 11-12 of the rulebook), and only that, rez cost differs from 'cost to rez' which means 'if you want to rez, do that'. With Dr Dreff, the ice is not rezzed (it is just encountered), so you don't trigger the reduction of rez cost. The Sleepy text just affects efforts to rez the Ice, not 'pay bits equal to card's rez cost' in general. (Tom Wylie 11/12/99)

@ You can dreff Dumpster on the archives because Dumpster's restriction is on 'installation' only, and Dr Dreff does not install the Ice.(Tom Wylie 11/12/99)]],
