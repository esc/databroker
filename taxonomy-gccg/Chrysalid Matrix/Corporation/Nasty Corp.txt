#Description:
#Last year, we played a 1/15 tournament with Chrysalid Matrix.
#The requirement was to have at least one third of Chrysalid Matrix cards in 
#your deck.
#
#I didn't have an idea how to build a real theme deck in 1/15 with Chrysalid 
#Matrix, so I built a "Nasty Corp", adding cards that can spoil Runner's plans.
#
#As you might notice, there are seven different agendas in my deck - this is 
#because of the Runner card Lars Dali.
#
#Deus has proven to be broken in one game where Runner had a full breaker suite 
#and over 30 bits - I only had 5 bits, but I safely scored the final agenda 
#behind a Deus. The other Chrysalid Matrix cards have shown to be nice and balanced.
#
#Twenty-Four-Hour Surveillance turned out to be a dead slot, because none of my 
#opponents played with Patience / One Hand Clapping / Looking Glass.
#
#A nice situation was the trashing of an Aubrey, Apprentice Cowboy, with 
#Underworld Mole against Bierfuizl: All installed Private Kelp Tanks got 
#trashed as well (but I finally lost that game anyway).
