#Description:
#I played with a "fat stack" (120 cards) for being allowed to include 8 
#AI Templates. AI Template is a useful, but balanced Chrysalid Matrix 
#card. With AI Template + Inside Job, you can auto-pass two ICE. 
#
#Archive Storage Service is less useful; I only included it for having 
#something to trash with AI Template and for fulfilling the requirement 
#with at least one third Chrysalid Matrix cards. 
#
#Lars Dali is a nice Chrysalid Matrix card, because it forces the Corp to 
#play with many different agendas; decks with only Employee Empowerment 
#or only Corporate War won't work once this card is in play. 
#
#The combo Security Code WORM Chip + Armageddon + Aubrey, Apprentice 
#Cowboy exploits the fact that Aubrey allows you to make two runs at the 
#end of your turn, after your 4th action. So you play an Inside Job on HQ 
#with action 1, then Worm Chip with action 2 (trashing Ice on R&D), use 
#Junkyard with action 3, Worm Chip again with action 4, trashing another 
#Ice on R&D. This only costs you three bits! Now, your turn would 
#normally end. But with Aubrey, you can now run an unprotected R&D and 
#give the Corp Armageddon counters. 
#
#And one note on Private Kelp Tank: It is a nice and balanced card, a bit 
#too slow for Constructed perhaps. In my opinion, the additional sentence 
#"If any of your other installed resources leaves play, trash Private 
#Kelp Tank" should be left away. 
#
#Comment from Bierfuizl: This was one nasty stack to play 
#against. My CM corp was too slow to set up and once R&D was naked I was 
#swarmed with Armageddon counters, pretty much ending the game.
