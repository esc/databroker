#Description:
#The main goal of this deck is to play the combination Artificial
#Security Directors and Corporate War. Pattel Antibody, TRAP! and Chimera
#serve to weaken runner's capabilities. Quite effective in doing 
#that is also the combination of Blood Cat and Closed Accounts.
#Political Overthrow is in there to fulfill the agenda points limit.
#In a real deck it might be advisable to play a 90 card version to avoid
#a defeat when runner liberates two Corporate Wars.
