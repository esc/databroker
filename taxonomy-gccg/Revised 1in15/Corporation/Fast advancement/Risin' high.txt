#Description:
#Hello everyone,
#so I finally found the time to post my Corp deck from the 1/15 tournament last 
#year. I played 6:0 with this deck (I used a different one for the finals).
#
#The aim is to be either faster than Runner and speed him out with Emp Emp, 
#fast advancement and ACME. Or, to surprise him with ACME, fat ICE and a 
#Sterdroid. Or, to become rich with the help of Corporate War and / or ACME, 
#and iceing HQ and R&D heavily (additionally with Glacier).
#
#In fact, the surprise with Sterdroid worked even better than I had expected: 
#I haunted two Runners, trashed a Cortical Cybermodem with Cinderella and dealt 
#damage with Shotgun Wire.
#
#Only one slot turned out to be weak/useless: Antiquated Interface Routines. 
#In the original Unlimited Revised version of this deck, I play with 4 
#Sterdroids, so for 1/15 I replaced one with Antiquated Routines which again 
#I switched for Offsite Backups which is better: Offsite Backups is a fine 
#combo with ACME, fast advancement and Sterdroid.
#
#I learned a lot about ACME when playing this deck:
#You can rez a Glacier *and* trigger *two* ACMEs with this deck! E.g. when you 
#have 1 agenda point left (after scoring one agenda and rezzing 1 Glacier and 
#1 ACME), you can rez another ACME for quickly getting over the 22 bits hurdle, 
#then score a Corp War with Management Shake-Up, and in your next turn: 
#Pay ACME back! You then have 4 agenda points again plus the bits for scoring 
#another agenda out of hand. Paying ACME back is an option that you often forget ...
#
#Good countermeasures against this deck are Inside Job, ICE destruction and 
#Priority Wreck or other bitsuckers (after I rezzed an ACME, those hurt badly).
#Greetings, Frizzler
