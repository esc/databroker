#Description:
#The deck's strings are a) "as expensive-to-pass subroutines as possible" 
#for defense and b) "dangerously consistent tracking" for offense. 
#a) think of card combos Sandstorm / Food Fight, ICE with multiple 
#subroutines in general, with Virizz and Crystal Palace Station Grid. 
#b) Hacker Tracker Central with Blood Cat and Manhunt can overcome even 
#the most solid tag defense eventually.
