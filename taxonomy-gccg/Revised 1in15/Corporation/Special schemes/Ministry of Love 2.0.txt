#Description:
#With version 2 you can fully experience power tracing with Blood Cat, 
#Hacker Tracker Central and subsequent Closed Accounts and Urban Renewal. 
#Roving Submarine adds persistence to that lethal mix and can make a 
#skyrocketing bit engine with Department of Truth Enhancement. The solid 
#ICE mix in version 2 can still profit from New Blood played as a 
#surprise and will be sufficient to defend the difficulty three agendas 
#for easy bits.
