#Description:
#The main goal of this deck is to put Nevinyrral or Remote Facility 
#into a Roving Submarine. When that is achieved the corporation can 
#score agendas in one turn. It should be enough to build one 
#subsidiary data fort for Roving Submarine, Puzzle would prove handy
#for that purpose. Otherwise ICE should protect the central data forts,
#mainly R&D but if runner is attacking HQ then protecting HQ and 
#Archives as the surprise back door becomes imperative. TRAP! is 
#included to make it somewhat less predictable if a Roving Submarine 
#contains valuables or not.
#In case runner installs Precision Bribery and/or Corporate Ally a
#second submarine fort with ICE might be needed to install the agendas.
