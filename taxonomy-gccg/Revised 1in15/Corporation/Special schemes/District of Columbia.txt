#Description:
#(60 cards deck) the conversion of the 50 cards Unlimited version to a 60 
#card 1/15 version implies minor changes only. Night Shift and Pattel 
#Antibody have entered the deck because they pull on the same string as 
#the rest which is quick reliable bit gaining and unpleasant traps. 
#
#Washington, District of Columbia City Grid reduces the agenda difficulty 
#by 1 which makes it particularly interesting for agendas with difficulty 
#3. After installation it is very likely to be run and trashed therefore 
#I chose to protect it with traps and other updates. These will be 
#overwritten when an agenda comes in handy. The bit gainers and the ICE 
#are chosen such that cards with high cost appear less often; the trilogy 
#of Efficiency Experts, Accounts Receivable and Credit Consolidation is 
#always a safe bet. Besides meta game considerations I have included ICE 
#with damage subroutines to make the traps potentially more dangerous. 
#Imagine a runner with a Force Shield who has happily saved some bucks 
#against a Liche just to encounter a TRAP! in Washington DC CG. Bolter 
#Cluster comes to mind but I want to keep the amount of ICE that relies 
#on specific circumstances, like second layer ICE or Glacier to an 
#absolute minimum. Bel-Digmo Antibody and Chimera are effective 
#countermeasures against specialized decks like R&D attack with Protocol 
#Files and Daemon tree decks like Bozomatic. An unrezzed Chicago Branch 
#looks as dangerous as an unrezzed trap but can decide a game quickly.
