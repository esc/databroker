#Description:
#As the title suggests this deck evolves around Black ICE. Skälderviken 
#SA Beta Test Site and Black Ice Quality Assurance modify Black ICE and 
#Priority Requisition should be used to rez Cinderella, Zombie and Liche. 
#The selection of agendas allows for spending one or two agenda points 
#for example on Glacier and/or ACME Savings and Loan, the latter can be 
#retrieved anyway.
