#Description:
#Olivia Salazar and payback ICE work especially well together on a Siren 
#fort with Rio de Janeiro City Grid. Since bits are an issue with many 
#Siren decks some bit gainers and savers like Chester Mix, Efficiency 
#Experts and Security Purge are included. Remap counters are also very 
#welcome as a failsafe option for Rio. Yet, if runner has no proper 
#protection accessing a Self-Destruct fueled by all those ICE and many 
#upgrades might bring about an abrupt win.
