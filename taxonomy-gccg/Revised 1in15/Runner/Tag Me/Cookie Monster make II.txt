#Description:
#It's basically a Scaldan deck. Some of the other versions I've seen of 
#this deck use the Bartmoss/Joan combo but I've found the breakers above 
#to be about the same in overall cost and often cheaper for big ice, and 
#they're obviously more stable than Bartmoss. 
#I didn't invent this deck (or the one below) but I have optimized it as 
#best as I can given the results of my playtesting and the restrictions 
#of the 1/15 format. Scaldan is a total bitch to deal with as the corp.
