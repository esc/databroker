#Description:
#A 1/15 Boostergang deck that sets up in two stages, first installing 
#multiple copies of Top Runner's Conference and drawing many cards. Using 
#those Boostergang Connections then extracts a couple of Rent-I-Con, 
#R&D-Protocol Files, Microtech AI Interface and optionally some 
#protection like Force Shield and The Deck. Pile Driver might possibly 
#save some bits against big walls.
