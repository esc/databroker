#Description:
#It's a Big Dig deck. This deck does amazingly well and still feels like 
#it has room to be optimized further. 
#Elena or Crash turns the simple cantrips (Cruising and Stakeout) into 
#powerful effects and both in play at once makes you mow through the deck 
#while simultaneously amassing bits. 
#The Remote/Danshi combo is still being tested but seems necessary 
#against any deck that stacks ice on R&D and/or plays with Superserum. 
#You typically have enough bits when you "go off" to end the game in one 
#or two turns. But sometimes the situation calls for you to run sooner 
#than you'd like, and your bit pool will run dry before you've dug enough 
#cards. That's when you should pull out the Remote/Danshi combo. 
#The ESC is strictly against corp decks that use lots of Traps and Setup 
#type cards. If the corp isn't playing them, you can ignore the ESC as 
#well as the WuTech Mem chip. 
#The hardest thing for this deck to deal with is when the corp plays 
#directly against the weakness of Top Runners' Conference - and advances 
#agendas with little or no protection. You need to make the call of 
#whether or not to run during these situations. It's fun and the deck's 
#power helps, because if you choose right you definitely win. If you 
#choose wrong, you'll still probably win but it will be closer.
