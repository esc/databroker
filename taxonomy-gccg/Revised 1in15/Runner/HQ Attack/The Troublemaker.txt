#Description:
#This deck aims at slowing the corp down by sucking bits and derezzing 
#ice. In the ideal case, the corp is busy all the time with scratching 
#bits and rerezzing derezzed ice, while the agendas gather on HQ. In the 
#end game, you play sync attack to get the agendas from HQ. 
#
#Note that the breaker suite was chosen such that weak ice is broken for 
#free; strong ice is very costly to break, but gets derezzed with 
#superglue. 
#
#In order to be able to run early, you might want to replace the Temples 
#with Self-Modifying Code.
