#Description:
#The title indicates that this deck tries to slow down the corporation.
#By using Start of Turn bit gainers, runner gets more powerful in the
#later game. Precision Bribery and the combination of Blackmail and
#Corporate Ally can withhold the corp by a few precious actions to enter
#the late game phase. In that phase runner should try to control with
#Technician Lover and Mouse. Disruptive runs on HQ can be assisted by HQ
#Interface and Mercenary Subcontract to trash fast advancement
#operations.
