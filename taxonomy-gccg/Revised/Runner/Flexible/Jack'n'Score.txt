#Description:		  
#This is the deck of my second constructed tournament. The idea isn't far 
#away from the Body'n'Score deck but I didn't have a lot of cards at that 
#time. So it is a deck for the upcoming constructed player with a limited 
#card pool. By the way, I played 3:2 with it (not bad for a runner deck).
