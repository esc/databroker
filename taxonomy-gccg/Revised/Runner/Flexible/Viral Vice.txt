#Description:
#This deck is geared to win by Bad Publicity. If you don't like BP, or 
#think Scaldan is cheese, try a different stack. 
#
#Theory 
#Do what you need to get the Corp up to 5 or 6 Bad Publicity 
#points. Most players will take their chances rolling for the Scaldan 
#viral counters until then. Use Incubator (with runs into the archives if 
#the Corp gets the forts protected) to multiply the viral counters. When 
#the Corp removes the viral counters, use the Poisoned Water Supply or 
#Faked Hit to finish them. 
#
#Remember, agenda means nothing to this deck. Cash in agenda points to 
#play Corporate Ally or make bits with Data Broker. The 3 agenda point 
#penalty of Arasaka Owns you can be ignored. It has no real penalty if 
#the Corp has viral counters from Scaldan. 
#
#A heavily protected HQ can be handled different ways. Shredder always 
#works well to stick a few surprise viral counters on the Corp. Cascade 
#runs on R&D can be even more problems for the Corp, as they toss those 
#agenda into the archives. This lets you win on agenda scored, keeping 
#the deck from being one dimensional.
