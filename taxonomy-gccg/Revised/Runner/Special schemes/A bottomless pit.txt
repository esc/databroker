#Description:
#Top Runner's Conference finances the installation of Clowns and breaker 
#suite into the daemon tree. Record Reconstructor and Gremlins make it 
#virtually impossible for the corp to draw new cards and at the same time 
#keep them for their next turn. This should severely disrupt any 
#elaborate plans.
