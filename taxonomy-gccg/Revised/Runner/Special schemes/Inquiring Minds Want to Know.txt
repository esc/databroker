#Title Explanation This is my bad publicity deck. I let everybody in on 
#the corp's dirty little secrets, because inquiring minds DO want to 
#know. 
#
#Notes on Deck building I needed bad pub, and as most is rare, I really 
#had to wait to make this deck. I still need more. In particular, I need 
#an Identity Donor. However, it is a running bad pub deck. I've heard of 
#a non-running Preying Mantis Poisoned Water deck that could be really 
#nasty. You'll notice there is no Classic in this deck. That's because 
#nothing there helped it. Disagree Tell me... 
#
#Note on Standard Play Be coy early with some mock runs. Don't start your 
#push into BP until you have saved in your hand and then surprise them 
#with Subliminal Corruption or Frame-Up. Then go full blast. Early, using 
#Scaldan with just 1 or 2 markers (don't add more, because then they will 
#just dump them. They won't usually do it for one or two. Give them bad 
#pub before they know how serious it really is! I'm just sad that most 
#play Scaldan as being Unique). Also, a Live News Feed leading into a 
#Frame-Up is wonderful. Then save the Poisoned Waters and Faked Hits as 
#end game cards. That usually does the trick. A friend of mine Deadlock 
#thinks this deck is a personification of evil. I don't think it's good 
#enough yet. What do you think?
