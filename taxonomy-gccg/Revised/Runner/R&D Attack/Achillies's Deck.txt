#Description:
#Title Explanation
#Every corporation has a weak spot. I believe this is R&D because the Corp 
#cannot control what is drawn there.  Heck, I even one a game in the Nationals 
#because instead of running on where the corp over protected the subsidiary fort 
#with the winning agenda in it, I ran on R&D on got the true winning agenda. 
#Therefore, this deck attacks this Achillies' Heel and punishes anyone who 
#protects it very little.
# 
#Total Cards 52
#
#Notes on Deck Building
#I've sure got a lot of different cards. That is part of what builds on this deck. 
#I love accessing tons of cards from R&D! The problem is some decks can build 
#quickly, so diversions are needed, as are ways of recovery. I've also been 
#thinking about a Remote Detonator and Dashi's Fake ID to this deck to be used 
#with the Private LDL Access. What do you think?
#
#Notes on Standard Yogi Play
#This deck tend to hammer and get tired out in one spot. The key point is getting 
#some Restrictive Net Zonings down quickly on R&D (before the corp money base is 
#down).  If you feel you have enough there, use them to weaken other areas.  Late 
#in the game, attack with discrimination, specifically using the Tech Lover. For 
#corps that are well protected, use the Private LDL with the tech lover to really 
#freak them out.
