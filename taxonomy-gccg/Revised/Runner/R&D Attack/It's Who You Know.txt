#Description:
#Attacks R&D. 
#
#Especially good on a Corp with multiple small data forts. 
#
#The inside jobs are best early in the game when the corp usually has the 
#one ice guarding R&D, even better after the R&D Interface is working for 
#you. 
#
#Your reliable Tech lover lets you peek to know when to get that 
#custodial position to sneak in some extra cards. 
#
#Can go to either a long drawn out battle, or win within a couple of 
#turns if the Corp can't Ice the R&D right away.
