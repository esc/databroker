#Description:
#This is obviously an Organ Donor bit engine, but it plays a little 
#differently based on what type of corp deck you are playing against. In 
#general, there are 3 types: 
#
#1. Speed Decks, like Psycho Tycho, which try to win in 3-5 turns given 
#an optimal draw 
#2. Tag-N-Bag decks 
#3. Everything else 
#
#Against a slow deck, this deck typically sets up in 15 or 17 actions. 
#
#Those 15 actions are: BSBx8, Organ Donor x3, Militech MRAM Chip x2, 
#Bodyweight {TM} Data Creche, Valu-Pak out R&D-Protocol Files, Microtech AI 
#Interface, and the 3 icebreakers 
#
#Against Tag-N-Bag, install your Militech MRAM Chips and dig for Identity 
#Donors. After you use 3, he can't try to Bag you any more. Use MIT West 
#Tier to recycle them. 
#
#Against Speed Decks, disrupt them by either grabbing the appropriate 
#icebreaker using Self-Modifying Code and/or BSBing for them. Use 
#Valu-Pak to drop multiple programs at a time. Use R&D-Protocol Files and 
#Microtech AI Interface to minimize useful cards corp will draw.
