#Description:
#Bugs Bunny's catchphrase is "Of course you realize, this means war!". 
#Strictly he appears as a hare but in cyberspace an escaping rabbit might 
#as well look like a hare. The rabbit deck retaliates traces and there is 
#a whole set of supporting cards for that. A card that can go well 
#together with Rabbit in some battles is Microtech 'Trode Set. It does 
#not filter the killer sentries though and so Redecorator becomes the 
#sentry breaker of choice supported by Clown and Lockjaw. Scaldan and 
#especially Back Door to Netwatch fit the retaliation scheme very well, 
#complemented by Faked Hit.
#Personally, I have never felt more comfortable to encounter a Hunter 
#than with this nasty deck and there is much fun to have with it.
