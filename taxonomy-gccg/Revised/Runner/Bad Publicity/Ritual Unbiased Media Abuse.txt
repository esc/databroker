#Description:
#The strategy of this deck is to use the corps pay for what it calls 
#legal commerce as effectively as possible. 
#
#Derez ice as much as possible because you have extra run actions that 
#will help you here. If you run up against a corp using black ice, do a 
#Live News Feed Senatorial Field Trip combo on them. Make extra money 
#using the Wilson Karl de Veres combo. Trash the corps advertisements On 
#the Fast Track and use some Subliminal Corruption to add insult to 
#injury. 
#
#Sooner or later, you are going to upset the corp and face meat damage in 
#doing so. You've got friends in all the right places so get an Identity 
#Donor. 
#
#Make a Bargain with Viacox once you have Dropp installed. 
#
#Since your such a on the go all the time, make sure you can get what you 
#need with Jack 'n' Joe and Bodyweight {TM} Synthetic Blood. If that doesn't 
#get it, do some Lucidrine {TM} Booster for that extra push. Exposing the 
#corps for what they truly are - (corrupt individuals using the net under 
#the guise of legal commerce to further their own agendas, by any means 
#necessary) - is a dirty and thankless job. 
#
#Let everybody know, by any means necessary, what the Corps are up to.
