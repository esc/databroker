#Description:
#100 cards Bad Publicity deck. The deck can start to build up more hand 
#size fueled by bits from Organ Donor. The actual bit gaining plan with 
#Smith's Pawnshop, Omnitech "Spinal Tap" Cybermodem, Crash Everett, Do 
#the 'Drine and Arasaka Owns You works as follows: When drawing cards 
#from stack leave an Arasaka Owns You on top, play Do the 'Drine to 
#discard all hand cards, leaving at least one hand size to draw and hold 
#that one Araska Owns You. At the start of the following turn sell the 
#Cybermodem to Smith's Pawnshop thereby inducing lethal damage which in 
#turn is prevented by Araska Owns You and which provides removal of brain 
#damage and plenty more cards. 
#The next stage of the deck includes dealing Bad Publicity points by 
#Frame-Up, Scaldan, Poisoned Water Supply for which Crash Everett and 
#Smith's Pawnshop come in handy and Faked Hit which doesn't hurt too much 
#with that kind of hand size available.
