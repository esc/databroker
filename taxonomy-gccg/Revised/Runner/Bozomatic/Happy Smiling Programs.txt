#Title Explanation
#This was the first true theme deck I ever made. It's based on many 
#clowns to reduce the run cost and breakers that can break subroutines 
#free. By phase 3, you should be able to run free most of the time (and 
#extra times, with Wilson). This is another deck that is hard to beat if 
#the game does get to later phases. 
#
#Notes on Deck building
#I'm still not sure on the money side of things, but it usually works out 
#to be enough (or I get blown out of the water). Either way, I may lose 
#some of these cards... I'm thinking of going with more Zetatech 
#Installers, even more Afreets, and a few Bundles Interesting Either way, 
#the Shell Traders have been remarkable effective and I'd use more if I 
#had the opportunity. 
#
#Note on Standard Play
#The biggest key to getting this deck to work is getting the Installers 
#and Shell Traders early with memory. If you do, this is a fairly fast 
#deck. That, and running early just to throw the opponent off (always a 
#good idea). Late, run continually, usually with many free extra runs 
#just to disrupt the opponent. Never let them breath.
