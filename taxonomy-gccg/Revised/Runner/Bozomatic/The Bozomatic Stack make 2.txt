#Description:
#Although the Bozomatic stack is one of the classics, it used to run with 
#a really nasty virus such as Scaldan or Viral Pipeline. These have now 
#been made 'Unique' and at the UK Championships 1999, Huw Morris made 
#some slight modifications to the standard deck and came up with this 
#stack. Huw won 1st place in the constructed event on the day. 
#
#The basic principle is that you draw cards fast and install programs 
#with Valu-Pak, saving money from the ZSIs. 
#
#Once you've got set-up, you can run for free and start planting lots of 
#Armageddon counters in R&D. 
#
#The deck is now slightly vulnerable with the introduction of Sterdroid 
#but it's still a solid deck.
