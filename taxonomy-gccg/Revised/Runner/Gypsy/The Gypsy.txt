#Description:
#This is a new deck designed around Gypsy Schedule Analyzer. It is still in 
#testing and may change in the near future. The deck relies on two 'run turns'. 
#During a run turn you would 1)Gypsy, 2)Promises/Hot Tip/Desperate (as 
#appropriate), 3)repeat step 2, 4)All-Hands. The key is setting up quickly. 
#1 point agendas may force you to take a third 'run turn'.
