#Description:
#My runner deck is called the Gypsy Mole, for obvious reasons. Its a 
#design I came up with some time ago when I was playing NR but I couldn't 
#make it work because I didn't have the TRCs for it. 
#
#A couple of points from the tournament - this is not a deck to play if 
#Corp is using City Surveillances - I gave up adding tags after I hit 36! 
#Closed Accounts is also bad news if tagged, I said I would publish part 
#of the game log for a laugh: 
#
#1:01:14 [cheffo] cheffo puts Closed Accounts to Graveyard from Play
#1:01:18 [Googol] Googol's life total is now 44 (-10)
#1:01:19 [Googol] Googol's life total is now 34 (-10)
#1:01:21 [Googol] Googol's life total is now 24 (-10)
#1:01:22 [Googol] Googol's life total is now 14 (-10)
#1:01:23 [Googol] Googol's life total is now 4 (-10)
#1:01:25 [Googol] Googol's life total is now 0 (-4)
#
#I may have set a record by losing 54 bits to CA Shocked .
#
#Anyway, back to the deck: the principle is simple, but I messed it up in 
#this tournament by trying to be too clever with the Rent-I-Cons and 
#Joans (I'd forgotten that the "trash Rent-I-Con" was subroutine based!). 
#I would recommend dropping them, and using only Krash as in my original 
#deck. 
#
#The idea is to draw and install lots of TRCs to build a large bit pool 
#(using misc-for-sale its possible to have 70 bits in your pool after six 
#turns). Then use Boostergang to start the last turn with a hand of: 
#
#Gypsy Schedule Analyzer x 4
#Remote Detonator
#
#The last turn is then:
#Actions: Bit cost
#
#1 Run with GSA 2 + X
#Activate False Echo 2
#2 Remote Detonate 7
#3 Run with GSA 2
#4 Run with GSA 2
#5 Use BDC to run HQ X
#and sequentially access all cards using HQ Moles 16
#
#32 bits are needed in the last round for fixed costs plus the cost of 
#two breaks (unless Corp has been clever and held back a Glacier). The HQ 
#run should be cheap unless Corp has a lot of bits because none of the 
#ice would have been rezzed on it till the BDC run and hopefully False 
#Echo will have forced Corp to spend most of their bits anyway. 
#
#I have a more detailed analysis of the in-game turns which I will post 
#if anyone is interested.
