#Description:
#Lots of ice that traces. Looking back on how things went, I should get 
#rid of the Netwatchs and the Bioweapons Engineering and replace 'em with 
#a couple Fetal AIs, or some silly three-pointer. And a little fast 
#advancement for those damn Identity Donor decks... 
#
#I was really excited when I first tried this deck out against Nat 
#Johnson...when he hit the Crybaby he had to pick it up and read it. 
#Heart-warming!
