#Description:
#This variant sticks close to the original one. An ideal situation could be the 
#use of two(!) ACME Savings and Loan for the second Corporate War. Get 24 bits 
#to overcome the threshold of 12 and get another 12 as a bonus. This costs 2 
#agenda points out of three from the possible Turn-One-Corporate War but we can 
#buy them back later! Gaining the bits this way is fast and we can move the 
#glaciers with them and Edgerunner some more. I chose ESA Contract as a draw 
#engine since it goes well with Edgerunner, is reusable and saves some deck slots.
