#Description:
#As I recall, Glenn mentioned that there's a fast advancement deck
#in R&D that's as good as the ACME/Tycho, yet has the 4-of-a-kind limit
#imposed.  I would imagine that it's a Gray Ops deck:
#
#Fast and Boring...  can you imaging what would happen if the 4-of-a-kind
#limit was really imposed!?  (ack.. I better shut up now..)
