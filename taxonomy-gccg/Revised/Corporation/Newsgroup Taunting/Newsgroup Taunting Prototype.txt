#Ok, I realize we're not trying to create the "perfect" NTD here, but I 
#think it's worthwhile to try to figure out how the deck is supposed to 
#win, and move toward that end. 
#
#Obviously, the way this deck wins is by getting out so many Tauntings 
#that the runner can't afford to get rid of them all, or spends so long 
#doing so that the Corp can openly advance agenda, winning the game. 
#
#So, how much is "so many"? That often depends on the Runner's bit 
#engine, and how far the game has progressed. At the beginning of the 
#game, if the corp were to draw, then install and rez 3 Tauntings, the 
#runner could (if he so desired) gain a bit, then spend 3 actions and 6 
#bits to get rid of the Tauntings. The Runner would be outta bits, but 
#the Corp would probably be outta Tauntings. So even three Tauntings at 
#the beginning of the game (when the runner has 5 bits and no bit engine 
#in place) isn't quite enough. What can swing the balance is being able 
#to drop 4 or more Tauntings in one turn when the Runner is still 
#relatively poor. That's where the Edgerunners come in. 
#
#Right now, you've got 10 Tauntings and 6 Edgerunners out of 45 cards, 
#which is a decent ratio, IMO. As it is, after the Corp's first draw, 
#there's approximately a 22% chance that you'll get an Taunting, and 
#about a 15% chance for Edgerunner. 
#
#What this deck needs is an increased chance of having/drawing multiple 
#Tauntings at one time, combined with an Edgerunner. One way to 
#accomplish this is to include Planning Consultants and Annual Reviews. 
#Ideally, the Planning Consultant would setup an Annual Review or Day 
#Shift as the top card, with the next 2-3 cards as Tauntings. Then you 
#can use the drawing card to get the Tauntings (or whatever) into your 
#hand to use with an Edgerunner to get multiple Tauntings out quickly. 
#
#One last point before I go. Why include all the virus test sites? Just 
#to deter people from running R&D? Why not use Setups, then? <ponder> 
#Maybe there's a hidden secret I've yet to fathom...
