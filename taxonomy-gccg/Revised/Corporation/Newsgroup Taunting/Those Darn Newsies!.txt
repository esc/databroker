#Description:
#45 Cards
#
#Ever think about what you would do if you had to pay 15 bits to make a run? 
#What if you couldn't even run where you wanted when you paid that 15 bits? 
#What if then you had to guess how many bits it would cost you to run? 
#Wonder no more, runner, for this dream is about to be come a reality...
#
#I think that Newsgroup Taunting is such a silly card, yet so cool, because 
#alone it forces the runner to pay one bit per run he makes, and only costs a 
#bit to rez. Coupled with Siren, the runner cannot even run where he wants. 
#I now present my new deck:
#
#The Plan
#The best thing we can do is install multiple Newsgroup Tauntings in the 
#beginning and play multiple Accounts Receivable. This gives us the money to put 
#our plan into action. Install minimal ICE on the Main forts, rather, wait to 
#install them on the subsidiary fort that will include Siren. With our large ICE, 
#Siren should be safe from the runner, and with all the Newsgroup Tauntings, it 
#should be worth the sacrifice should the runner access Siren. Build Marine 
#Archologies first to help our accounts, and then wage Corporate War with our 
#competitors if it looks profitable. Project Babylon is worth activating if we 
#are unable to win the wars or build the Archologies. Note that all of our ICE 
#have multiple subroutines that will keep the runner out of our hair if he 
#cannot break them. Employ the newsgroups well, they are our greatest weapon,
#but they are fragile, and cannot stand an assault by the runner.
