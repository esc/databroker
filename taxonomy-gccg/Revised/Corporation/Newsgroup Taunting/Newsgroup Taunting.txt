#Description:
#Here's my Newsgroup Taunting deck, its not a killer deck but one of merit, 
#runners usually look puzzled the first time (always nice to do) and seem to 
#miss the obvious solutions to beat this deck to a pulp.
#What is netrunner if not trying to get away with outragious behaviour.
#The maths - 4 NGTs and a glacier means that the bit war is yours, even if they 
#are playing loans. This deck origianally had no glaciers just more pay-back 
#ice, so the numbers of cards are negotiable, for example you might find the 
#Networked centers just too good, while the Rios are slighly out of place. 
#A BBSWC or two can work well too.
#All I can say is that in the 2 tournaments I played with this deck - it did 
#better than expected and is fun to play. Anyway how to play this deck??... 
#To complicated to explain, every scenerio is different so I'm not going to bore you.
