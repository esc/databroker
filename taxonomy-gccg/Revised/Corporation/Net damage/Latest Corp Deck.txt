#Description:
#I haven't played it much, but the few times I tried it out, it worked 
#fairly well. It's a lot of fun to see someone run an SDF, take 2 from 
#the FAI, and have to trash the Red Herrings and rerun because they 
#couldn't afford to take it the first time, taking another 2 net in the 
#process. Then, a quick TH and SE and buh-bye Mr Sillyrunner. My plans 
#are to put about 4-5 Dieters Either in an SDF and score the agenda, or 
#R&D. It'd be fun to see someone hit a FAI and 4 or 5 Dieters all at 
#once. I might also drop the ice for Setups. The Edgerunners are great 
#for getting out the agenda and multiple upgrades at once.
