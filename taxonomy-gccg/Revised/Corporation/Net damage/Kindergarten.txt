#Description:
#Trivia: It appears that the New Galveston City Grid has its name from 
#the city of Galveston in Texas. The effect of making trashing more 
#expensive could be linked to the real-world city's preservation movement 
#that followed a stagnant period in economy in the 1960s.
#The name of the deck is chosen because it nurtures Fetal AIs in the cosy
#and messy environment of playful Red Herrings.
#The recipe of this deck is to make it insanely expensive and painful for
#the runner to steal agendas. Put a few Red Herrings in a New Galveston 
#City Grid and/or in the central forts. 
#Since Death from Above is its nemesis, Underworld Mole and Closed Accounts
#are included as first-strike prevention or retaliation.
