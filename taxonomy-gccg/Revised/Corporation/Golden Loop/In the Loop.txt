#Description:
#Possible replacements: Colonel Failure and Liche, Haunting Inquisition 
#and Mazer. 
#
#The CBs work nicely as decoys later on and I only need them in the early 
#game so a single ice will deter the runner for enough time to get the 
#cycle going. And, late in the game, if I still have a CB that I can use, 
#it allows me to process agenda even more quickly.
