#
#A Plan for World Domination
#
#To rule the world is a dream of cartoon mice and the 21st
#century corporations which inhabit the Netrunner multiverse.
#World Domination, a corporate agenda from the Proteus expansion,
#aims for just that -- a one-card win. No muss, no fuss. Advance
#and score one agenda, and the world is yours.
#
#The World Domination agenda is most difficult to accomplish -- the
#corporation has to add 12 advancement counters to the card in
#order to gain three agenda points, plus the card-text bonus which
#awards the corporation four additional agenda points. In contrast,
#the second-hardest agenda to complete is Political Overthrow,
#which awards six agenda points for nine difficulty.
#
#The first bit of arithmetic that favors a World Dominating
#corporation is that the runner opposing a 45-card,
#tournament-legal deck containing six World Dominations has to
#steal three of them to win, whereas the corporation has only to
#score one.
#
#Part of World Domination's charm lies in its "B"-movie grandiose
#-- in one fell swoop, rule the world and win the game! The card is
#also intriguing for its impracticality. No one I know includes it
#in even a whimsical deck -- the obvious question "how do you score
#it?" deflates many ambitious players.
#
#I suggest a deck makeup which gives a World Domination plan a
#serious chance for success. Be the first Napoleon on your
#Netrunner block to conquer the world. The deck construction
#described here won the Silicon Netrunner tournament in Sunnyvale,
#Calif., in December.
#
#* The Tortoise and the Hare
#
#There are two methods of agenda advancement. One is pay one bit to
#add one advancement counter to the card. The other is to pay 5,
#10, or 12 bits to play operations (Systematic Layoffs, Management
#Shake-Up, Project Consultants) which permit multiple advancements.
#
#The first method is cost-efficient (one bit per advancement
#counter) but very slow. The longer the agenda remains on the
#tableau, the more likely it is that the runner will steal it. The
#second method is expensive, but often results in scoring agenda
#directly from HQ.
#
#It's inordinately difficult to advance an agenda 12 times. To
#install and advance the card once per action would take at least
#four turns, all the while keeping the fort safe from the runner,
#not to mention the other forts. To score World Domination directly
#from Headquarters -- a safer route, since the agenda is less
#vulnerable in HQ -- would cost 38 bits. That is, two bits to play
#Corporate Guard Temps, which gives the corporation an extra action
#on his next turn, then installing World Domination and playing
#three Project Consultants.
#
#Yes, that's a five-card combination which costs 38 bits -- no one
#said conquering the world is easy. It is slightly more expensive
#-- 40 bits -- and more efficient to play one Overtime Incentives
#and three Project Consultants in the same turn, but the inclusion
#of Corporate Guard Temps will be discussed below.
#
#A crafty corporate player will advance World Domination with both
#methods, often in combination.
#
#* The Preemptive Strike
#
#In the earliest stages of the game, the runner is searching for
#his ice breaking programs, and striving to earn the bits necessary
#to install and run them.
#
#By installing Filter and Data Wall (the least-expensive ice with
#"end the run" subroutines), and Shock.r (the least-expensive
#"stun" sentry), the corporation can halt the runner while saving
#bits to pay for agenda advancement. As the runner develops his
#breaker suite, the corporation should improve the subsidiary fort
#with Rio de Janeiro City Grid and more ice.
#
#Riddler and Sandstorm from the Proteus set are stronger pieces of
#ice which might be considered for inclusion, since they allow the
#corporation to pay for a different number of "end the run"
#subroutines during each encounter with the runner.  A wealthy
#corporation might just pay to protect his agenda.
#
#The other upgrades to the subsidiary fort are Lesley Major,
#Bizarre Encryption Scheme, and Red Herrings. Lesley Major from the
#Proteus expansion ("pay 3 to add two advancement counters to this
#card only after the last piece of ice on this fort has been
#passed") seems designed to add venom to an advanceable ambush
#node, but in unison with Red Herrings ("runner must pay 5 in
#addition to other costs to steal agenda from this fort") or
#Bizarre Encryption Scheme ("runner doesn't steal agenda from this
#fort upon accessing; return it to the fort and the runner steals
#it at the start of his next turn unless the corporation scores it
#by then"), Lesley Major is the only card in Netrunner which allows
#the corporation to advance an agenda during the runner's turn.
#
#Red Herrings intends to frustrate the runner before the
#corporation is able to score the World Domination. When the
#corporation has the agenda in its sights, Bizarre Encryption
#Scheme slaps a much stronger lock on the fort.  Chester Mix
#reduces the cost of installing ice on the critical subsidiary fort.
#
#* Plan B
#
#Should the runner install all of his icebreakers (a generic
#icebreaker like Bartmoss Memorial or Krash is a definite bane for
#this deck), the World Dominating corporation must move quickly.
#Edgerunner, Inc. Temps will serve to install an upgrade, as well
#as another piece of ice or two. (Beware! Runners are adapting to
#the "many pieces of cheap ice over Rio" strategy by employing
#Startup Immolator.)
#
#Remember, eight advancement counters already played plus one
#Project Consultants wins the game, and more cleverly, an action
#gained by Corporate Guard Temps can also be used for a single
#advancement.
#
#If the runner steals a partially-advanced World Domination, cash
#in a Silver Lining Recovery Protocol for three bits per
#advancement counter. If World Domination was advanced seven times
#before the runner broke through the Shock-enhanced and
#Rio-bolstered Filters and Data Walls, two Silver Linings could be
#redeemed for 42 bits, enough to play the fore-mentioned 38-bit
#combination.
#
#After the Silver Lining windfall, the corporation would like to
#play Corporate Guard Temps. There are then three distinct tactics:
#
#1) The corporation has 38 bits and three Project Consultants in
#hand: Play Corporate Guard Temps and pay two bits, which gives the
#corporation one extra action on his next turn. At the next turn,
#install World Domination, and Project Consult three times to win.
#
#2) The corporation has 32 bits and two Project Consultants in
#hand: Play Corporate Guard Temps and pay four bits. The
#corporation will need seven actions over two turns to install a
#World Domination, Project Consult twice, and advance the agenda
#singly four times. This is a slight improvement over installing
#the World Domination in the same turn you play Silver Lining,
#because the agenda is installed (i.e., vulnerable) for one fewer
#turn.
#
#3) If the corporation has more than 18 bits but no Project
#Consultants in hand:  Pay six bits for Corporate Guard Temps, and
#conduct four actions per turn for three turns. Perhaps advancing
#World Domination singly over three turns rather than four will
#find the luck of Rio de Janeiro on the corporation's side.
#
#* Nose to the Grindstone
#
#A plan to dominate the world requires focus. Bits should be gained
#through operations rather than nodes, since they pay more per
#action. Prefer Accounts Receivable to Credit Consolidation because
#Accounts Receivable is playable from the initial draw, and time is
#of the essence  -- soon the runner, if not some masked superhero,
#will come calling. Silver Lining Recovery Protocol should result
#in one or sometimes two large bit influxes per game. Also, the
#fewer nodes the corporation has in his deck, the fewer useful
#cards the runner can trash.
#
#Rustbelt HQ Branch is perhaps the most useful node, for hand size
#is crucial to any corporate headquarters which houses three
#Project Consultants and a Corporate Guard Temps, along with any
#surfaced agenda. Euromarket Consortium costs two to rez, but has a
#higher trash cost, and confers the additional ability of drawing
#two cards with an action. Late in a game where the corporation is
#trying to score World Domination with Project Consultants, the
#power to draw that Project Consultants, or an Accounts Receivable
#to pay for it, is a plus.
#
#"Yeah, the world would swing if I were king."--Tom Petty
#
#I wrote the above about six weeks ago. Since then, the deck makeup
#described above has gone through a few minor changes -- it still
#wins more often than it loses, but *always* in great style, and
#that's what makes the deck so much fun to play.
#
#Minor changes:
#
#* Filter and Data Wall have been upgraded to Quandary/Sleeper and
#Data Wall 2.0, so the Code cracking and Jackhammering runner has to
#pay a bit or two on the way through. Vacuum Link was added for the
#purpose of installing on top of Rio de Janeiro (a 3-cost,
#5-strength sentry is a lot of bang for the buck), and Neural Blade
#might replace Shock.r soon, with the hope that a runner might die
#someday on a Vacuum Linked Blade.
#
#The ice breakdown at the moment is: 4 Data Wall 2.0, 4 Quandary, 3
#Shock.r, 2 Vacuum Link.
#
#* A bit node, Braindance Campaign, was added. Ideally, Braindance
#Campaign will be installed with an Edgerunner, and it's neatly
#convenient to take two Braindance bits, draw, and advance World
#Domination three times.
#
#Nodes: 2 Euromarket Consortium, 1 Braindance Campaign
#
#* Two Credit Consolidations took the place of two Accounts
#Receivable. Just once or twice have I been unlucky to have a
#Credit Consolidation in hand with the initial draw, and been
#unable to play it.
#
#* The biggest change -- Overtime Incentives replaced Corporate
#Guard Temps. All the neat planning that went into the inclusion of
#Corporate Guard Temps flew out the window for two reasons. 1) It
#proved impractical in practice to know exactly when to play
#Corporate Guard Temps and for how long. 2) If the runner steals an
#advanced WD, and the corporation has no Silver Lining Recovery
#Protocol in hand, then he has to draw one. If the mandatory draw
#doesn't pull a Silver Lining, and the first Euromarket draw
#doesn't pull one, what if the second Euromarket draw pulls two?
#Then the corp should play Overtime, and two Silver Linings. This
#makes it impossible to pull off the fabulous 40-bit nirvana coup
#of Overtime/install World Domination/Project Consult/Project
#Consult/Project Consult, but maybe a laboratory mouse brainier
#than I will include an Off-Site Backups in his deck.
#
#Operations: 5 Accounts Receivable, 2 Credit Consolidation, 3
#Silver Lining Recovery Protocol, 1 Overtime Incentives, 2
#Edgerunner, Inc. Temps, 3 Project Consultants
#
#General observations:
#
#* A World Domination deck is not well-suited for tournament play,
#for one scores zero agenda points in a loss. (However, I will
#continue to play it just to amuse my opponents.)
#
#* The best runner counterattack against the "World Would Swing" is
#to ignore the subsidiary fort until the last possible moment, and
#concentrate on stealing agenda and trashing upgrades from the
#central forts (virus decks are more effective against "World Would
#Swing" than any other kind of runner deck). "The last possible
#moment" is often sooner than the runner thinks, though -- for
#instance, a World Domination advanced five times is in range when
#the corporation has 19 bits (Overtime Incentives, advance,
#advance, advance, Project Consultants).
#
#* Promises, Promises and Hot Tip for WNS easily swing the game
#in the runner's favor, for he needs to liberate two World
#Dominations rather than one.
#
#* Do not play one or more Project Consultants until it wins. Keep your
#powder dry.
#
#* Play economically. Given a choice between installing one card,
#or drawing a fifth or 10th bit (for the purposes of Accounts
#Receivable or Credit Consolidation), draw the bit, and hope to
#Edgerunner the installed card later. (That's good advice for any
#deck, I tell myself with a smack to my head.)
#
#* I have never been coy about the card being advanced in the
#subsidiary fort -- Jim McCoy has called the deck, "All World
#Domination, All the Time." Still, runners are always wary about
#rushing into a huge ambush node -- would you like to be
#remembered as the runner who hit a Vacant Soulkiller with 10
#counters? That wariness could possibly be played upon by including
#an ambush node in a World Domination deck, but not installing
#it. By never installing it, the corporation will not lose time by
#advancing it, and if the runner accesses the ambush node from a
#central fort, the uncertainty about the advanced card in the subsidiary
#fort will grow.
#
#An obvious question is, "can World Domination co-exist peacefully
#in a Namatoki/ambush node fort?" I believe the answer is no --
#there's no time. It takes time and money to dominate the world,
#and a World Domination deck must be in constant motion. Install
#it, and advance it -- the plan described here works because it is
#a homogeneous system. That is, if you advance and score the first
#WD out of hand, great -- but sometimes you have to cash in a Silver
#Lining or two in order to fast advance the next one. The deck
#works as a whole. :)
