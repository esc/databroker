#Description:
#50 cards
#
#I already played this deck at several constructed tournaments in 1998 and 1999 
#and it hasn't been changed much since then. I still love to play it because it 
#is really different and strong and fun to play. For this UK format tournament 
#with BMI and Rent-I-Con more or less banned, I included one Aardvark instead 
#of the 5th Edgerunner inc just for fun and surprise, because I expected 
#everyone to play with a real breaker suit and Aardvark is such a rare card in 
#practical gameplay.
#
#Back in the old days most runners ignored the installed CNCs because of the 
#large numbers and high trash cost and concentrated on R&D and HQ attack (which 
#is not a bad idea in my opinion). In this tournament, however, all of my 
#opponents concentrated on trashing all open CNCs, even if it cost lots of bits 
#and actions. This surprised me a bit, and I had to adapt my gameplay: I had to 
#protect the first and second CNC with small ice, or Glacier if it shows up early 
#enough. In the future I might prefer to play with 2 instead of just 1 Glacier for 
#this reason.
