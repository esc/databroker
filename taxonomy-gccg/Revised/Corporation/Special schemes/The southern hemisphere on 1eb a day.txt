#Description:
#The idea of this deck, as you may have noticed, is that no cards cost 
#more than one bit to rez. You always have enough money (especially if 
#you have Chester Mix). As you can easily install cards, your main 
#strategy is to keep your HQ full (Annual Reviews, Day Shifts and 
#Employee Empowerments) and score a Corporate Downsizings with your Vapor 
#Ops when you have too many agendas in it. If you manage to install 4 or 
#5 layers of ice in front of Rio de Janeiro City Grids, you'll almost 
#never see a runner rummaging through your data. Very satisfying. 
#
#I've built a runner deck with the same concept (bit less in Seattle - 
#Netrunner, Shadowrunner, same difference :) but it doesn't work as well 
#against ice with high strength (the cheap icebreakers cost a lot to pump 
#up). And it has two Dupre as Mantis can't go in the deck. Maybe I'll add 
#some 2-bit cards to help.
