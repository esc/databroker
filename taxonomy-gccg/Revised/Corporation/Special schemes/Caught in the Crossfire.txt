#Description:
#Any Runner that faces this Corp gets caught up in the Corporate War that
#/Caught in the Crossfire/ is engaged in. Almost all of the cards can be
#related to the War except for perhaps the HIs. Otherwise it mostly plays
#like other Tag n Bag.
#
#Commentary
#
#The ICE is mostly there to knock out cards.
#
#The Corp Wars are nice since they allow you to maintain enough bits for
#a Tag n Bag kill. Since when you score them by fast advance you go from
#18* to 24*.
