#Description:
#Project Venice is an agenda that is looked at by many potential
#Corporations but then disregarded as not being that good.  Needing 4
#advancement counters to just score 2 agenda points is not worth it
#when compared to other agendas that give the Corporation some bonus
#for that amount of work.  The 7 advancement counters needed to get
#the action bonus often appears too difficult to perform reliably.
#
#Extra actions are almost always worth it, especially if they are
#not limited in what they can do.  Edgerunner, Inc., Temps and Valu-Pak
#Software bundle are popular cards and the actions they provide are
#very narrow.  Any time one player gets an extra action every turn, it
#starts to put a strain on the opponent.  Actions are the very basis of
#play, and the more you have, the faster you can implement your plans.
#
#The flexibility of Project Venice is where it shines.  In an
#agenda plan comprised solely of Project Venice, if the Corporation can
#gain two extra actions from the first few Projects scored, the 
#remaining ones can be scored out of hand in one turn without the aid
#of other cards.
#
#There are two main strategies to go about getting those two extra
#actions for the plan.  The first is to advance one Project Venice 10
#times and get the two needed actions.  The other method is two
#advance two separate Projects 7 times each.  Both strategies require
#either a lot of bits poured into fast advancement to score them in
#one turn or a plan to hold the agendas long enough to advance them.
#
#The idea now is to build a deck that can execute of those plans.
#Here, not too much effort is required as another crafty R&D can provide
#the skeleton we need.  This deck is Frisco's World Domination deck.  Some
#changes obviously are needed as the agenda setup requires 9 cards instead
#of 6, but here I present the current version of my R&D.
#
#Agendas (9)
#These are the basis for this whole plan.  Scoring one Venice with 10
#advancement counters gives the Corp a very strong position from
#which to score the remaining agenda.  So while its not the game winner
#than World Domination is, the flexibility in going to 7 or 10 for the
#extra actions helps to make up for it.  It is also a lot easier to
#acquire the 9 cards.
#
#Ice (14)
#The ice selection is pretty much the same here.  The idea is the same,
#cheap ice that will pretty much always require the Runner to pay at
#least 1* or 2* to pass each piece of ice.  The Marionette is an
#experiment but so far hasn't shown its worth.
#
#Upgrades (3)
#Here some cuts were made to make room for the agendas.  The agendas
#don't need to be protected for quite as long so can survive with the
#lesser amount of Upgrade based protection.
#
#Nodes (3)
#Not including the Virus Test Site was a style decision.  It should have
#the same mass damage potential that it does in the Domination deck.  The
#extra Euromarket Consortium is included to make sure one is drawn.  The
#deck sometimes needs a while to dig up the 3rd and 4th agendas, especially
#if the Runner steals a few, and these greatly speed up the process.
#
#Operations (16)
#Here, one Protocol is replaced with one Accounts as a steadier bit supply
#is needed to score the extra Projects, not the big surge of bits the
#Domination deck needs to score just the one agenda in one turn.
#
#These may not be optimal for this deck but they have performed ok so far.
#Like the Domination deck, there are many bit/card combinations for
#scoring the agendas.
#
#Well, thats my deck plan as it stands now.  Based on the Domination
#plan, it is fairly solid itself.  It has something of an advantage by
#looking so much like a Domination deck early on.  The Runner might
#wait till the Corp is in striking range of 12 advancement counters when
#the Corp suddenly springs out the 2 extra actions from only going
#to 10.  If the Corp does not have access to the plans to rule the
#World, it can always start with Venice.
