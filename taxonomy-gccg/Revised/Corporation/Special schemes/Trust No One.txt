#Description:
#As you can see, there are no bit-gainers at all. On reflection, I should 
#have included some lower-cost ice, so I could have a chance to rez it in 
#front of the first Security Purge. The beginning of each game usually 
#involved taking bits until I could rez up a Data Naga or Zombie in front 
#of the first installed Security Purge. 
#
#Dr. Dreff, Lisa Blight, and the Executive Extraction never got used. If 
#I owned two Executive Extractions I might replace a Security Purge with 
#them. As it is, I would have been better off to leave it out. Dr. Dreff 
#and Lisa Blight were never used, even though I installed them. It might 
#be better to just replace them with a couple of low-cost ice. 
#
#This R&D was very fun to play. Taking that crap shoot each time I scored 
#a Security Purge was really exciting. After the Siren is installed, it's 
#no real problem to lose a Security Purge into the Archives, since the 
#Runner can't run without dying. I probably should have included another 
#Siren just to make sure it was there when I needed it. There was a game 
#where I scored a Security Purge and had to trash two Sirens. That was 
#painful :) 
#
#This idea is not for the weak of heart. It hurts to have a hand of 
#Mastiff, Mastiff, Cerberus, Colonel Failure and know that you are never 
#going to install any of them. The good news is that there are plenty 
#more where that came from. 
#
#An early Inside Job is also be crippling, and a dedicated Clown setup, 
#like Dennis Duncan's, would also be deadly. 
#
#It took me almost a year to get 9 Security Purges. This is one case 
#where I think it was well worth it. This deck is a blast to play.
