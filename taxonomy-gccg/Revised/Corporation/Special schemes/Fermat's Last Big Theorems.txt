#Description:
#A variant to the Big Button deck that makes use of Theorem Proof. 
#Instead of pillaging the Archives with Stereogram Antibodies the corp 
#can get away with discarding and losing that agenda to runner in the 
#first turn. It will be impossible to score three such agendas in one 
#turn without any preparation beforehand. 
#
#The general recipe for a Big Button can be outlined as follows:
#Turn 1 SOT(BITS 5) Draw one card
#-A1(BITS 5) take 1 bit
#-A2(BITS 6) install Panic Button
#-A3(BITS 6) install Executive Boot Camp
#
#Runner runs HQ: 
#Rez Executive Boot Camp, discard 4 cards gain 8 bits, Use one of these 
#bits to rez Panic Button, then draw cards, use EBC again and so forth 
#to draw all cards remaining in R&D except for one. 
#
#For the Theorem Proof variant the corp continues like that:
#Turn 2 SOT(BITS 6) draw one card
#-A1(BITS 6) Edgerunner: Pacifica Regional AI, Theorem Proof, 
#ACME Savings and Loan
#-A2(BITS 5) Team Restructuring (Pacifica Regional AI(1 AC), 
#Theorem Proof1 (1 AC))
#...
#-A6(BITS 1) Team Restructuring (Pacifica Regional AI(2 AC), 
#Theorem Proof1 (5 AC)), score Theorem Proof1, trigger ACME (BITS +12)
#-A7(BITS 12) Edgerunner (Theorem Proof2, Theorem Proof3) | 
#Pacifica Regional AI(1 AC)
#-A8(BITS 11) Team Restructuring (Pacifica Regional AI(1 AC), 
#Theorem Proof2 (1 AC))
#...
#-A12(BITS 7) Team Restructuring (Pacifica Regional AI(1 AC), 
#Theorem Proof2 (5 AC)), score Theorem Proof2
#-A13(Bits 6) Team Restructuring (Pacifica Regional AI(1 AC), 
#Theorem Proof3 (1 AC))
#...
#-A17(Bits 2) Team Restructuring (Pacifica Regional AI(1 AC), 
#Theorem Proof3 (5 AC)), score Theorem Proof3, win with 8 AP
