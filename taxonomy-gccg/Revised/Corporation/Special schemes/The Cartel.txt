#Title Explanation
#The oil cartels have some very great advantages.  Everyone needs what they 
#produce, so they constantly get money, and sometimes even more when American's 
#panic.  The deck focuses on constantly dripping bits from agendas and nodes.  
#Once this cartel takes control, no one can stop the snowball!
# 
#Notes on Deck building
#This is the opposite number of The Infamous Drip Deck.  It's not as good as 
#that deck, but it is interesting that few opponents expect it.  That's usually 
#enough to get the snowball rolling, and it isn't uncommon for this deck to gain 
#4 bits per turn before taking the first action.  That keeps your defenses up. 
#However, it is light on ice, so it can have mixed results.
#
#Note on Standard Play
#Try to get a dripping agenda scored quickly.  If you can't do it, you probably 
#won't be able to win with this deck.  Other than that, watch the opponent 
#closely and go for the agendas when they show weakness of any sort.  The 
#advancement cards are primarily to allow extra bits early, but work well to 
#seal the victory.  Good luck!
