#Description:
#I chose a mixture of walls that do not look too futuristic to go with 
#the theme. The agendas reflect the Mediterranean Sea and the political 
#decision of Athens to send tribute to the island of Crete (including 
#human food for the Minotaur, i. e. new blood!). For reasons of flavor, 
#Trojan Horse is a must-include, so this deck needs a way to make use of 
#tags, which I chose to be Scorched Earth (as Troy was burnt and razed to 
#the ground). As for the rest: well, Siren, Chimera and Cerberus aren?t a 
#perfect fit strategically, but they just had to show up as prominent 
#members of the ancient Greek bestiary. They might be good for a nice 
#surpise, though. Data Masons and BBS Whispering Campaign, on the other 
#hand, do not fit the flavor theme that well, but they are necessary for 
#the “walls” part and plain old bits to pay for it all, respectively. 
#Perhaps you can think of the Masons as Daedalus and Icarus (who built 
#the labyrinth), and the Campaign might be Ariadne whispering into 
#Theseus's ears how to survive the labyrinth.
