#Description:
#Here is my runner deck from the tournament. Results with it weren't 
#great but it probably holds the record for the fastest deployment of a 
#full 4-strength breaker suite (2 turns). 
#
#The breaker installation engine works well, and the design could be 
#adapted, but the great thing about MT is that if you drop a Mystery 
#Box/Joan and run twice you can virtually guarantee at least one access 
#to any iced data fort in the first turn 
#
#The Scaldan and Armageddon are there for early game lock-down if the 
#draw and ice are right, and the Faked Hit/PWS for late game to drop 
#those last two bad publicity points that never seem to get rolled. 
#
#The deck's main weakness is shortage of bits in the late game as 
#Morphing Tools are expensive to use against ice with lots of effective 
#subroutines.
