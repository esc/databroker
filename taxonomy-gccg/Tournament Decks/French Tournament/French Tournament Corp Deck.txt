#Description:
#I made sure I had a proper mix of agenda: it was impossible to get to 7
#agenda points without meeting an Ambush, or in less than 3 cards. The
#Corporate Headhunters were invaluable in countering the Emergency Self
#Constructs I met... and the Viral Breeding Ground was often advanced
#openly against Daemon-filled decks.
#
#Most of the time, the mere threat of tags was enough to keep runners _very_
#careful and make them passive enough. The City Surveillance proved to be my
#most feared weapon: in one game, I had the two of them behind double layers
#of unrezzed ice, and the Runner didn't even dare attack them (he hadn't
#installed a full suite of 'breakers), so he drew cards paying _2_ bits for
#each (needless to say, I won). In another, I rezzed a CS when the Runner
#drew for his last action with no bit left; this let me play a Scorched Earth
#on the next turn, stripping him of his only Code Gate breaker.
