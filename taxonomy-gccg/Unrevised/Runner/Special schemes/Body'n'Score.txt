#Description:
#The runner deck from Hannover. It is fast from the start and gets
#stronger because of the Clowns (they can be used for Organ Donor first
#and installed after the first use of MIT). If you want it faster for
#Psycho Tycho replace the Mercenary Subcontract and Death from Above with
#Bartmoss and Joan.
