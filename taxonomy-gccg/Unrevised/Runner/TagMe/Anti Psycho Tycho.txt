#Description:
#47 Cards
#
#As I said before, Closed Accounts is the real problem. There
#are a few ways around it but none of them are super-reliable.
#
#You could also switch to a bit engine of Loans and the
#backup cards I had in the previous (dumb) deck list. That
#makes the Remote Detonator more problematic but also lets
#you play with tons of cool resources like Junkyard BBS.
