#Description:
#Strategy 
#The object of this deck is to plant Boardwalk viruses in HQ via Wilson and 
#Shredder Uplink Protocol. Get the Code Viral Cache out ASAP and keep it in play. 
#Install HQ Interface quickly also. Once you know the corp has an agenda in HQ, 
#play an All-Hands. You should access every card the corp has if they have a 
#normal hand size. Score the agenda and trash everything else with Crumble. The 
#Credit Subversions and Synchronized Attack on HQs are in there to deplete the 
#corp's bits. If the corp ices the archives, use Security Code WORM Chip to get 
#rid of the ice.
#
#Some modifications to this deck I have used are Lucidrine {TM} Booster Drug and 
#various bit engines. Also, you might want to use Restrictive Net Zoning on HQ 
#and Archives to provide a deterrent for ice. A different icebreaker suite can 
#be considered. Remember that you can't use noisy icebreakers with All-Hands.
