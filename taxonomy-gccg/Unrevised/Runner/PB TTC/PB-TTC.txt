#Description:
#I've read messages on this list from Philippe Duchon, Matthias Nagy, and 
#Richard Clyne about the Netrunner tournament last Saturday in Paris, and 
#the PB/TTC deck. 
#
#Well, I was the guy who was playing the PB/TTC deck. I finished the 
#tournament at the 2nd place. 
#
#I recognize that playing a PB/TTC deck is not really fun, yes. But what 
#to do against fast advancement, Tycho corp decks ?? 
#
#Anyway, this deck is now "retired". I'll play it only when people ask me 
#specifically to play it for training.
