#Description:
#It's sorta kinda speed advance but to gain actions, not score lots of 
#agenda points. It's slow that's for sure, but imagine your opponent's 
#face when he sees you taking 11 actions every turn(okay, that's absolute 
#best case and any decent corp will have scored the Tychos instead, but 
#it's cool! =-)
