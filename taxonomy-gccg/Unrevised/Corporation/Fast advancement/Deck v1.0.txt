#Description:
#Strategy
#The basic theory is that it operates as a speed deck (sorry to bring
#magic into it),you have low cost agendas that you get through quickly
#using operation cards. The ice is also all low cost to allow for lots of
#it to be got down quickly, it's not quality it's quantity(or something
#like that). The Bizarre Encryptions should let you stop the runner getting
#too many of your agendas,and you should be able to score them in your
#turn with the operation cards like Systematic layoffs.
