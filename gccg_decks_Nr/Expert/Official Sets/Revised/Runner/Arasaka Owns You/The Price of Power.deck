#Description:
#You are one of Arasaka's hottest runners, they give you access to all their hot 
#equipment, but they want something in return. Every bit of information you 
#collect! But life is great as one of Arasaka's goons, they protect you when 
#you're in trouble, they give you high-tech others could only dream of, right 
#now you're cruising cyberspace with you're Deck testing that little new Bo they 
#developed and finding out what secrets it holds. Soon you're Quest will be at 
#an end, you're close to Cattekin. Then you'll retire.
#
#Well this is the weirdest deck I've ever seen let alone develop, it's strictly 
#a fun deck, cause I don't think I'll ever make it work for tournaments. It's 
#still in its play testing stage, so if anybody got new idea's to improve it, 
#besides ripping it apart, I'd be glad to receive them. Don't be afraid of the 
#high numbers of rares in it, I'm too still using proxies.
#
#How can this deck work
#Simple I always wanted to make a runner deck with lots of actions therefor 
#include several Quests, to get rid of the brain damage effect I decided to 
#include AOY which works good with the extra actions. Now to get rid of the AP-
#forfeiting I first tries milling the corp, but found out that Scaldan seems 
#more appropriate. Now to use Arasaka I'd have to flatline myself, so I started 
#with Blinks, but then saw the light to use Test Spins. Now I to decide what to 
#use with Test Spin and another card came naturally Mystery Box, with that I 
#could decide to go for good expensive Icebreakers, ending up with AI Boon, 
#Bulldozer, Raffles. Now to compensate for losses due to Quest, I had to include 
#MIT's and a deck was born.
#
#The basic idea is to install Quests, get you low on bits, Test Spin for Mystery 
#Box, run an appropriate fort, use Mystery Bo to hopefully install a useful 
#program, get flatlined, play Arasaka to remove brain damage you suffered from 
#Quest, fill up your hand, get new bits do this until you've got a couple of 
#extra actions and the important programs out, then run HQ multiple times and 
#kill the Corp with Bad Publicity.
