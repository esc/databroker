#Description:
#Here is my Corp deck. As I mentioned in my earlier post its a variant of a deck 
#called Super Employment that I found on the net some time ago.
#
#It is pretty straightforward to play - get an ambush down and advanced at least 
#three times and you can score an agenda from hand if you have an FTE and two 
#bits. The Team Restructuring is just there to make more efficient efficient use 
#of the bit used to advance the agenda. Using EE as an agenda means that once 
#you have scored one or more you can use the EE draw to get to the next agenda 
#quickly when you have the means to score it that turn.
